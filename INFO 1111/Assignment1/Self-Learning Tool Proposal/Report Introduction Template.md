* Conclusion: it is good for:
  * Writing and testing programs.
  * Writing and manage reports.
  * Time management.

### Pre-requisite knowledge

- [x] Experience of programming.
- [x] Basic knowledge of editor.

## Resource Search

### Level 1

https://github.com/condy0919/emacs-newbie/blob/master/introduction-to-builtin-modes.md

This is a tutorial for emacs, which introduces the basic built in modes of emacs.

### Level 2

http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html

This is a tutorial for eLisp, which introduces how to programming in eLisp.

### Level 3 and Level 4

These two-level is based on the knowledge I will study in level 1 and level 2, so there is no resource for these two-level.

## *Domain of Application - Editor and IDE*

Emacs is a powerful extensible editor, if the user know how to write a configuration, emacs can even replace an IDE.

Editor perspective: 

Emacs can be used to write report, it has org-mode which is for keeping notes, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming and more.

IDE perspective:

Emacs can be used to write program, it can be used to compile, run and test program, it supports auto-complete of different languages.
